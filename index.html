                Iguig (Ibanag: Ili nat Iguig; Ilocano: Ili ti Iguig; Tagalog:
                Bayan ng Iguig), officially the Municipality of Iguig, is a 4th
                class municipality in the province of Cagayan, Philippines.
                According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 27,862
                people. It is best known as the hometown of Dado Banatao, a
                well-known Filipino-American software engineer credited for
                having developed the first 10-Mbit Ethernet CMOS with silicon
                coupler data-link control and trans-receiver chip. The town of
                Iguig was founded by Rev. Ambrocio De La Madre De Dios, O.P. on
                December 28, 1607. This maker, attached by the Philippine
                Historical Commission to the façade of the parish church,attests
                to the antiquity of Iguig. The native name of the town is “IHIG”
                and tradition has it that it was the name of the chieftain of
                the village which the Spaniards made into a “pueblo” on December
                28,1607 and the Dominicans accepted as a “mission” on April
                16,1608 with Santiago Apostol as the Patron Saint.

                        It is said that in the early 1970’s, a team of local and
                        foreign archaeologists uncovered fragments of fossilized
                        ornaments and clay pots around various locations in the
                        town of Iguig. Some believe these artifacts prove the
                        existence of an ancient pottery industry that flourished
                        hundreds or even a thousand years ago.

                        The church’s location is another of its advantages. The
                        centuries-old church is built on an elevated area, the
                        Calvary Hills, which gives pilgrims an awesome view of
                        the mighty Cagayan Valley River, the longest river in
                        the country. There’s actually a brick stairway, which
                        goes straight from the church property into the river.
                        There’s also a lovely, old well within the church
                        grounds that add a charming touch.

                Apart from the religious and cultural sites, Iguig's natural
                beauty may attract tourists interested in exploring the scenic
                landscapes and the Cagayan River. The region's rich biodiversity
                and the potential for outdoor activities might make it an
                appealing destination for nature enthusiasts.

            <h1 class="subtitle">Tourist Spot</h1>
            <p class="tourist-spot">
                1. Visit St James Parish Church This church is located beside
                Cagayan river. Built of stones and brick materials between 1765
                to 1787, St James Parish Church is the first of its kind in
                Cagayan Valley to hae galvanized iron sheet roofing. It also has
                buttresses, a feature built that's designed to withstand
                earthquakes like that of Paoay Church in Ilocos.
                <br />
                <br />

                2. Calvary Hills I know the 2017 Holy Week or Semana Santa is
                fast approaching. In the Philippines this is a big deal being a
                Catholic country. If you are looking for new churches to see for
                your Visita Iglesia tour in 2017, I super recommend St. James
                Parish Church and of course, Calvary Hills. Both of these are
                just beside each other. The Mount Calvary of the Far East was
                conceptualized by Rev. Father Rogelio Cortez. It was constructed
                in 1982 and located in a sprawling 4 hectares of rolling hills
                overlooking Cagayan River which many says resemble Jordan river.
                This site features 14 Stations of the Cross and life-sized
                concrete statues depicting Jesus Christ suffering before his
                death.
                <br />
                <br />
                3. Iguig's Centuries - old Old Well Just ten-minutes away from
                the Calvary Hills and St James Parish Church, this old well
                which was built in 17th century is properly preserved. Made of
                limestone and bricks, this well used to be the main source of
                potable water for the whole municipality during Spanish era.
                <br />
                <br />
                4. Atulu Bricks and Pottery Center The town of Iguig especially
                in Atulu is blessed with the right kind of soil that's perfect
                for pottery - making compared to other areas of Cagayan. Located
                near Cagayan river, it is no doubt that Iguig holds the title of
                bricks pottery center of the province. Established in the
                pre-war days, this kind of livelihood survived even from the
                devastation of World War 2 and now the major industry of
                Barangay Atulu. Today, under the supervision of the local
                municipality the bricks and pottery-making here in Iguig is
                under the One Town, One Product project.
                <br />
                <br />
                5. Dabbay Falls Nestled in the rolling hills in the eastern
                Barangay of Gurab, you'll find Dabbay Falls just 5 kilometers
                away from Maharlika highway. This falls features a crystal-ike
                water running in abundance all through out the year. Its waters
                emanate from the foot of Sierra Madre and cascade down to
                Lalamagan Creek forming this fall. This place guarantees you a
                calming moment that only the rushing of the brooks and the
                singing of birds will disturb you.
                <br />
                <br />
                6. Jubilee Cross The Jubilee Cross is the authenticated relic of
                the True Cross of Lord Jesus Christ reminding His saving death
                and resurrection and the renewal of all creation through Him.
                This relic was a gift of Archbishop Bruno Torpigliani, the late
                Papal Nuncio to the Philippines to Arch. Diosdado Talamayan -
                the Archbishop of Cagayan. You'll find this inside the St. James
                Parish Chapel.
                <br />
                <br />
                7. Bricks Staircase This staircase made of bricks are located in
                between the Calvary Hills and St. James Parish. During the
                Galleon trade, this is where the goods are loaded and unloaded
                coming from Cagayan river. Also dignitaries who visit Cagayan by
                way of the river also uses this as an entry point. As you see,
                the stairs are no longer near Cagayan river which can make you
                wonder why. That's because the trail of the river changes over
                time. Maybe climate change or mother nature's will... no one
                knows why.
                <br />
                <br />
                8. St. Claire Monastery If you are looking for a place of
                meditation and spiritual retreat in Cagayan, go to St. Claire
                Monastery. Frequently visited by pilgrims seeking the
                intercession of St. Claire for favors they want to obtain from
                the Father Almighty, this monastery is the perfect place when
                you visit this province.
