                Iguig (Ibanag: Ili nat Iguig; Ilocano: Ili ti Iguig; Tagalog:
                Bayan ng Iguig), officially the Municipality of Iguig, is a 4th
                class municipality in the province of Cagayan, Philippines.
                According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 27,862
                people. It is best known as the hometown of Dado Banatao, a
                well-known Filipino-American software engineer credited for
                having developed the first 10-Mbit Ethernet CMOS with silicon
                coupler data-link control and trans-receiver chip. The town of
                Iguig was founded by Rev. Ambrocio De La Madre De Dios, O.P. on
                December 28, 1607. This maker, attached by the Philippine
                Historical Commission to the façade of the parish church,attests
                to the antiquity of Iguig. The native name of the town is “IHIG”
                and tradition has it that it was the name of the chieftain of
                the village which the Spaniards made into a “pueblo” on December
                28,1607 and the Dominicans accepted as a “mission” on April
                16,1608 with Santiago Apostol as the Patron Saint.

                        It is said that in the early 1970’s, a team of local and
                        foreign archaeologists uncovered fragments of fossilized
                        ornaments and clay pots around various locations in the
                        town of Iguig. Some believe these artifacts prove the
                        existence of an ancient pottery industry that flourished
                        hundreds or even a thousand years ago.

                    <p>
                        The church’s location is another of its advantages. The
                        centuries-old church is built on an elevated area, the
                        Calvary Hills, which gives pilgrims an awesome view of
                        the mighty Cagayan Valley River, the longest river in
                        the country. There’s actually a brick stairway, which
                        goes straight from the church property into the river.
                        There’s also a lovely, old well within the church
                        grounds that add a charming touch.

                Apart from the religious and cultural sites, Iguig's natural
                beauty may attract tourists interested in exploring the scenic
                landscapes and the Cagayan River. The region's rich biodiversity
                and the potential for outdoor activities might make it an
                appealing destination for nature enthusiasts.
